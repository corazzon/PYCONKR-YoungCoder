<div id="ppt" markdown="1">
Adding many choices:

"***If*** there’s mint ice cream, I'll have a scoop.<br/>
    Or ***else*** if we have vanilla, I'll have 2!<br/>
    Or ***else*** if there’s chocolate, give me 3!<br/>
    Or I’ll just have a donut."

Adding more choices in our code with the elif clause:

```python
>>> if name == "Katie":
        print("Hi Katie!")
   elif name == "Barbara":
        print("Hi Barbara!")
   else:
        print("Who are you?")
```

But what if we have many options to choose from?
