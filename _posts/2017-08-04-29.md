Try some of these expressions in your interpreter.

```python
>>> True and True
>>> False and True
>>> 1 == 1 and 2 == 1
>>> "test" == "test" 
```

See if you can predict what answers Python will give back.
```python
>>> 1 == 1 or 2 != 1
>>> True and 1 == 1
>>> False and 0 != 0
>>> True or 1 == 1
>>> "test" == "tests"
>>> 1 != 0 and 2 == 1
```
