One of the ways we do that is with “if statements”.

<div id="ppt" markdown="1">
Making decisions:

"***If*** you're hungry, let's eat lunch."

"***If*** the trash is full, go empty it."


If a condition is met, 
perform an action:

```python
>>> name = "Katie"
>>> if name == "Katie":
        print("Hi Katie!")
```

```
Hi Katie!
```

Here are some examples of some ‘if statements’ that you might use in real life, and an example of how you might use that in code.

(Explain indentation here - Idle should automatically indent for them, but they need to know that in most Python interpreters they will need to indent 4 spaces themselves)
