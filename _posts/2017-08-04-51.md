title: 함수 - 입력 INPUT
---

<div id="ppt" markdown="1">

```python
>>> def hello_there():
        print "Type your name:"
        name = input()
        print("Hi", name, "how are you?")
```
Here’s another way to pass input to a function - ‘raw_input’ is a built in Python function that let’s us interact with our function in a different way. 
</div>

<div id="desc" markdown="1">

# {{page.title}}
A shortcut:

>>> def hello_there():
       name = input("Type your name: ")
       print ("Hi", name, "how are you?")

>>> hello_there()
Type your name: Barbara
Hi Barbara how are you?
</div>
