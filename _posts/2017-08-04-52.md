title: 함수 - 입력 INPUT
---

<div id="ppt" markdown="1">
Input is information we pass to a function so that we can do something with it.

```python
>>> def hello_there(myname):
      print("Hello", myname)

```

In this example, the string “Katie” is the input, represented by the variable myname.
```python
>>> hello_there("Katie")
‘Hello there Katie’
```
</div>

The input() function takes input from the user - you give that input to the function by typing it.

```python
>>> def hello_there():
        print "Type your name:"
        name = input()
        print("Hi", name, "how are you?")
```
Here’s another way to pass input to a function - ‘raw_input’ is a built in Python function that let’s us interact with our function in a different way.
