More things we can do with variables:
Get an index from a string:
```python
>>> fruit = "watermelon"
>>> print (fruit[2])
```
Do some math to get the index:
```python
>>> mynumber = 3
>>> print (fruit[mynumber-2])
```

Let's look at just a couple more things you can do with variables. 

Remember when we were looking at strings, and we talked about indexes? An INDEX is the position of a character in a string. Well, if a variable has a value that's a string, we can get an index from it as well.

Let's go ahead and try this first example. You might already have created a variable named fruit from earlier in this lesson. Now let's find the character that's at the index of two in that variable's string value.

Type the print command, the variable, and then a number inside the square brackets. When you hit Enter, did you get the character you were expecting?

And here's one last easy example. We've already seen a few ways we can use variables to do math. Well here's one more way - we can use a variable inside those square brackets to calculate a number.

Go ahead and type this example - create the variable 'mynumber', then use it to get an index from the 'fruit' variable.
