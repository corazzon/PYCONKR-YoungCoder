title: 파이썬과 말해봐요 - (문자열) 단어와 단어를 연결하기
---

{:.summary}
문자열을 연결 할 때: `+`
여러번 문자열을 할 때: `*`
  
```python
>>> "Hi" + "there!"
```
```python
>>> "HAHA" * 250
```

Remember those operators we used for doing math? Well, we can also use some of them to do things with strings.

And here's a new word: concatenate. Concatenation is a little bit like adding - we use it to put words together, but side to side.

And multiplying controls how many times we show a string.

So try these examples and see what Python gives you.
