You can also use booleans in their own expressions:

```python
>>> True and True
>>> True and False
>>> False and False

>>> True or True
>>> False or True
>>> False or False

>>> not True and True
>>> not True or True
```
</div>

So what do you think happens when we use the word ‘not’ in front of a comparison?
