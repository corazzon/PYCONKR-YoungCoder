<div id="ppt" markdown="1">
Adding a choice:

"***If*** you're hungry, let's eat lunch.<br/>
    Or ***else*** we can eat in an hour."

"***If*** there's mint ice cream, I'll have a scoop.<br/> 
    Or ***else*** I'll take vanilla."


Adding a choice in our code with the else clause:

```python
>>> if name == "Katie":
        print("Hi Katie!")
    else:
        print("Impostor!")
```
</div>
