`if/elif/else practice`

{:.summary}


<div id="ppt" markdown="1">
Write an if statement that prints "Yay!" if the
variable named color is equal to "yellow".

Add an elif clause and an else clause to print two different messages for other values of the variable.

```python
>>> color = "blue"
>>> if color == "yellow":
        print("Yay!")
    elif color == "purple":
        print("Try again!")
    else:
       print("We want yellow!")
```       
</div>
