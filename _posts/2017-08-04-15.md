Create a variable and give it a value:
```python
>>> color = "yellow"
>>> color
 'yellow'
```
Now assign a new value:
```python
>>> color = "red"
>>> color
 'red'
>>> color = "fish"
>>> color = 12
```

And once you make a variable, you can give it a new value.

Try typing the example at the top. You're making a variable with the name 'color', then giving it the string 'yellow' as a value.

Next, when you type the word 'color' and press Enter, Python should return the value of your variable, 'yellow'.

Now let's give 'color' a new value. Go ahead and type the second example as it's written - remember that the variable doesn't have quotes around it, but the new value, 'red', does have quotes because it's a string.

When you enter the variable name again, you should see the new value.

Go ahead and try giving your variable some other new values, like different strings or even some numbers.
