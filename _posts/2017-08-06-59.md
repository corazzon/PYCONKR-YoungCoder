<div id="ppt" markdown="1">
_Conditional_ loops repeat until something happens (or as long as some condition is True).

{:.summary}

```python
>>> count = 0
>>> while (count < 4):
        print("The count is:", count)
        count = count + 1
```

```
The count is: 0
The count is: 1
The count is: 2
The count is: 3
```

The while keyword is used to create this kind of loop, 
so it is usually just called a while loop.

(Point out how the counter is increasing each time we go through the loop. Talk about infinite loops.)
