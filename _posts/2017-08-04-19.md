Assigning values or making comparisons?
```python
>>> fruit = "watermelon"
>>> 5 = 6
```
```python
>>> fruit == "watermelon"
>>> 5 == 6
```

Here's one last thing I want to add before we move on - and this doesn't just apply to variables, but to strings and numbers as well.

When we create a variable and give it a value, we use a single equals sign to assign that value.

But remember earlier when we were working with numbers and we used the double equals sign to do comparisons?

One equal sign or two? How can you remember which one to use?

Well here's how I remember.

When we're assigning a value, we're just saying "this equals that". That's a short sentence, so it only gets one equal sign.

But when we're comparing values, we're asking "is this thing equal to that thing?". And that's a longer sentence, so it gets two equal signs.
