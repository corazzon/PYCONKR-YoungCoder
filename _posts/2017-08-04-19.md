```python
>>> "friend" * 5
‘friendfriendfriendfriendfriend’

>>> "friend" + 5
Error
```
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly
```
* What do you think ‘str’ and ‘int’ mean here?
* Does this error message tell you what’s wrong?


Now we’re going to talk about something that’s really important in programming - errors and error messages.

Error messages are our friends - they’re a good thing, because they tell us what went wrong.  Without error messages, it’s hard to fix something that’s broken.


Try entering these expressions and see what answers Python gives you.  The first expression multiplies the word ‘friend’ and prints it 5 times.

What is the second expression supposed to do?  Should it concatenate “friend” and 5?  What happens instead?
