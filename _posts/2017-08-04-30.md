<div id="ppt" markdown="1">
List: a sequence of objects

```python
>>> fruit = ["apple", "banana", "grape"]
>>> numbers = [3, 17, -4, 8.8, 1]
```

Guess what this will output:

```python
>>> type(fruit)
>>> type(numbers)
```

</div>

<div id="desc" markdown="1">
Guess what this will output:

>>> type(fruit)
<class 'list'>

>>> type(numbers)
<class 'list'>
</div>
