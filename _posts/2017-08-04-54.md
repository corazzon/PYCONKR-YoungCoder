Lots of modules are included in the Python Standard Library.
Here’s how you can use a few of these modules:

Generate a random number between 1-100:
```python
>>> import random
>>> random.randint(1,100)
```
What timezone does your computer think it’s in?:
```python
>>> import time
>>> time.tzname
```
Print a calendar for this month!:
```python
>>> import calendar
>>> calendar.prmonth(2016, 6)
```
</div>

When you ‘import’ a module, you can use all the functions inside that module.

(Emphasize the distinction between the module name and the function name.)
