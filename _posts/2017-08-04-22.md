A Boolean value can be: 
```
True or False
```

Is 1 equal to 1?
```
>>> 1 == 1
True
```

Is 15 less than 5?
```
>>> 15 < 5
False
```

Now let’s talk about another new type that you’ll work with in Python.
A boolean only has two possible values - it can either be True or False.

Booleans are a pretty simple idea, but they’re very important - we use them in programming a lot when we need to make decisions about what to do in our code.  For example, ‘If an expression is True, do something; if that expression is False, do something else instead’.

Notice that we’re also using some of our comparison operators here - equal to and less than.
