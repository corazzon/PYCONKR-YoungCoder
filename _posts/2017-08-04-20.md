<div id="ppt" markdown="1">
```python
>>> "friend" + 5
Error
```
How can we fix this error?
Concatenation won’t work.

```python
>>> "friend" + "5"
friend5 
```
What if we make 5 a string?

What’s another way that we could fix this error?
Let’s do something new with the print command:

```
>>> print("friend", 5)
friend 5
```
</div>

<div id="desc" markdown="1">
# {{ page.title }}

<div class="teacher">
(point out the comma used with the print command, and how it adds a space between the two objects)
</div>
