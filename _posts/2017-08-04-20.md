```python
>>> "friend" + 5
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly
    ^              ^       ^              ^
```
* ‘int’ is an integer
* ‘str’ is a string
* Python cannot concatenate objects of different types


Now let’s take a look at that error message and see what it’s really telling us.

The first two lines are pretty common to all error messages, so they won’t really help us much here.  But the last line gives us some valuable information.

We tried to concatenate two pieces of data - which Python calls ‘objects’ - the string “friend” and the number 5.  But Python isn’t able to concatenate those two objects because they’re of different types.  And so we get what’s called a “TypeError”.
