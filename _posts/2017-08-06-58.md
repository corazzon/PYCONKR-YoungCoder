<div id="ppt" markdown="1">
Counting loops repeat a certain number of times - <br/>
they keep going until they get to the end of a count.

{:.summary}

```python
>>> for mynum in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
        print("Hello", mynum)
```

```
Hello 1
Hello 2
Hello 3
Hello 4
Hello 5
```

The for keyword is used to create this kind of loop, 
so it is usually just called a for loop.
