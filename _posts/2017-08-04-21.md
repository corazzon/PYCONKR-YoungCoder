title: (데이터) Data types

<div id="ppt" markdown="1">
We already know about three types of data:

```
 “Hi!”                 string
    27                     integer
    15.238                 float

```

Python can tell us about types using the type() function:

```python
>>> type("Hi!")
<class 'str'>
```
Can you get Python to output int and float types?

Just like ‘print’, ‘type’ is a built-in function that comes with Python.

Python has a lot of built-in functions, which we’ll learn about later.
